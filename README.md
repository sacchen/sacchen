# Samuel Chen

Mathematics & Scientific Computation student at UC Davis, interested in modeling, simulation, and decision systems.

I build practical Python projects: simulation engines, terminal tools, and technical research writing.

## What I'm building

### [short-your-friends](https://github.com/sacchen/short-your-friends)
Trading exchange / limit order book simulator with typed interfaces and a matching engine.

- Price-time priority matching
- Layered architecture (network -> interface -> engine)
- Settlement bookkeeping + validation checks
- Benchmark-focused engineering and reliability testing

### [phil](https://github.com/sacchen/phil)
Terminal-first symbolic calculator (`philcalc` on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/philcalc/)).

- Exact-by-default results for symbolic workflows
- Fast terminal solving flow without browser context switching
- Predictable one-shot + REPL behavior for repeatable usage

### [go-engine](https://github.com/sacchen/go-engine)
Go game engine with bots and tournament runner.

- Full rules handling (captures, ko, termination)
- Scoring + state validation
- Edge-case-focused tests

### [flightimpact](https://github.com/sacchen/flightimpact) *(in progress)*
Learning-focused quantitative modeling project for flight CO2 estimation under uncertainty.

- Deterministic baseline model + explicit assumption tracking
- Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation workflow
- Validation against public calculators with route-level error analysis
- Methods and sprint documentation for reproducible modeling

## How I work

- I like issue-driven development and clean commit history, inspired by [The Perfect Commit](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/).
- I use Issues heavily to track scope, assumptions, and follow-up work.
- I use `uv` for fast, reproducible Python environments and tooling.
- I do my best work with clear problems, regular feedback, and long-term ownership.

## Collaboration

I am interested in collaborating on structured technical projects and research-oriented engineering work.

I am also exploring making a coding club for math students focused on practical Python projects (bots, calculators, and simulation tools).

## Writing

I blog at [sacchen.github.io](https://sacchen.github.io), including technical/policy analysis.
