# Hi, I'm Samuel 👋

Mathematics & Scientific Computation student at UC Davis, interested in modeling, simulation, and decision systems.

I build Python projects that are practical to use: simulation engines, terminal tools, and technical writing/research.

## What I'm building

### [short-your-friends](https://github.com/sacchen/short-your-friends)
Trading exchange / limit order book simulator with typed interfaces and a matching engine.

- Price-time priority matching
- Layered architecture (network -> interface -> engine)
- Settlement bookkeeping + validation checks
- Benchmark-focused engineering and reliability testing

### [phil](https://github.com/sacchen/phil)
Terminal-first symbolic calculator (`philcalc` on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/philcalc/)) for exact math workflows.

- Exact-by-default arithmetic
- REPL + one-shot CLI parity
- User-focused onboarding and error hints

### [go-engine](https://github.com/sacchen/go-engine)
Go game engine with bots and tournament runner.

- Full rules handling (captures, ko, termination)
- Scoring + state validation
- Edge-case-focused tests

## Writing

I blog at [sacchen.github.io](https://sacchen.github.io), including technical/policy analysis:
